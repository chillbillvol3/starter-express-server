Express is a library that makes building servers in node easier.
Attributes of an object are called properties.
In a get request you are just asking for information from the server, where as a post 
request, actual information is sent to the server.
In order to define a get post:
```
app.get()
```
In order to define a post request:
`app.post()

Most secure way of sending information is through the body of a post request.
